//DEVELOPER'S NOTES//
I chose to complete the Challenge homework.  It was quite the challenge.  Although the game has 100% of the functionality as specified in the project instructions, the JS code is a bit too lengthy.  Going forward, I will continue honing my JS skills to improve code efficiency.  So although I'm satisfied with the look, feel, and functionality of this product, it flirts with , bends, and breaks the D.R.Y [Don't Repeat Yourself] rule.

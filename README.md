//DEVELOPER'S NOTES//
After 3 weeks of JavaScript training, I chose to complete the more challenging homework.  And  yes, it was quite the challenge.  Although the game has 100% of the functionality specified in the project instructions, I think the JS code is a bit too lengthy.  

I applied some of the concepts we covered this week (setInterval, setTimeOut, clearInterval, etc).  However, after looking at my final JS code, I definitely need to continue honing my JS skills to improve code efficiency, especially the ability to leverage functions and for loops to avoid repetitive code.  

In sum, although I'm satisfied with the look, feel, and functionality of this product, it flirts with , bends, and breaks the D.R.Y [Don't Repeat Yourself] rule.
